            <strong>Storage of Personal Information</strong>
            <br /> <br />
            Little Big Shed is a New Zealand company. For the purposes of the
            General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), New Zealand is considered
            a country which provides adequate protections for Personal
            Information, as confirmed by the European Commission in Commission
            Decision 2013/65/EU.
            <br /> <br />
            Little Big Shed uses third-party service providers (such as managed
            hosting providers, card processors, CRM systems, and technology
            partners) to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking,
            storage and other services that we use to operate the Service. Some
            of these providers may not be located in New Zealand.
            <br /> <br />
            By using the Service or submitting any Personal Information to
            Little Big Shed via the Service, you consent to Little Big Shed and
            its authorised service partners using your Personal Information in
            New Zealand in order to make the Service available to you.
            <br />
            <br />
            We will only retain your Personal Information for as long as
            necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including the
            purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting or statutory reporting
            requirements.
            <br />
            <br />
            In order to determine the appropriate retention period for Personal
            Information, we consider the following factors; the amount, nature
            and sensitivity of the data, potential risk of harm from
            unauthorised use or disclosure, the purposes for which we process
            your Personal Information and whether we can achieve those purposes
            through other means.
            <br />
            <br />
            We may retain certain information subsequent to the termination of
            your account, for example, if it is necessary to fulfil our legal
            obligations or to exercise, to maintain security, to prevent fraud
            and abuse and to defend or enforce our rights.
            <br />
            <br />
